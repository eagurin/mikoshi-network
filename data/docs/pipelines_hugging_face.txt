Pipelines
The pipelines are a great and easy way to use models for inference. These pipelines are objects that abstract most of the complex code from the library, offering a simple API dedicated to several tasks, including Named Entity Recognition, Masked Language Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, Feature Extraction and Question Answering. See the task summary for examples of use.

There are two categories of pipeline abstractions to be aware about:

The pipeline() which is the most powerful object encapsulating all other pipelines.
Task-specific pipelines are available for audio, computer vision, natural language processing, and multimodal tasks.
The pipeline abstraction is a wrapper around all the other available pipelines. It is instantiated as any other pipeline but can provide additional quality of life.

Simple call on one item:

>>> pipe = pipeline("text-classification")
>>> pipe("This restaurant is awesome")
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998743534088135}]
If you want to use a specific model from the hub you can ignore the task if the model on the hub already defines it:

>>> pipe = pipeline(model="FacebookAI/roberta-large-mnli")
>>> pipe("This restaurant is awesome")
[{'label': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.7313136458396912}]
To call a pipeline on many items, you can call it with a list.

>>> pipe = pipeline("text-classification")
>>> pipe(["This restaurant is awesome", "This restaurant is awful"])
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998743534088135},
 {'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9996669292449951}]
To iterate over full datasets it is recommended to use a dataset directly. This means you don’t need to allocate the whole dataset at once, nor do you need to do batching yourself. This should work just as fast as custom loops on GPU. If it doesn’t don’t hesitate to create an issue.

import datasets
from transformers import pipeline
from transformers.pipelines.pt_utils import KeyDataset
from tqdm.auto import tqdm

pipe = pipeline("automatic-speech-recognition", model="facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h", device=0)
dataset = datasets.load_dataset("superb", name="asr", split="test")

# KeyDataset (only *pt*) will simply return the item in the dict returned by the dataset item
# as we're not interested in the *target* part of the dataset. For sentence pair use KeyPairDataset
for out in tqdm(pipe(KeyDataset(dataset, "file"))):
    print(out)
    # {"text": "NUMBER TEN FRESH NELLY IS WAITING ON YOU GOOD NIGHT HUSBAND"}
    # {"text": ....}
    # ....
For ease of use, a generator is also possible:

from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("text-classification")


def data():
    while True:
        # This could come from a dataset, a database, a queue or HTTP request
        # in a server
        # Caveat: because this is iterative, you cannot use `num_workers > 1` variable
        # to use multiple threads to preprocess data. You can still have 1 thread that
        # does the preprocessing while the main runs the big inference
        yield "This is a test"


for out in pipe(data()):
    print(out)
    # {"text": "NUMBER TEN FRESH NELLY IS WAITING ON YOU GOOD NIGHT HUSBAND"}
    # {"text": ....}
    # ....

model (str or PreTrainedModel or TFPreTrainedModel, optional) — The model that will be used by the pipeline to make predictions. This can be a model identifier or an actual instance of a pretrained model inheriting from PreTrainedModel (for PyTorch) or TFPreTrainedModel (for TensorFlow).
If not provided, the default for the task will be loaded.

config (str or PretrainedConfig, optional) — The configuration that will be used by the pipeline to instantiate the model. This can be a model identifier or an actual pretrained model configuration inheriting from PretrainedConfig.
If not provided, the default configuration file for the requested model will be used. That means that if model is given, its default configuration will be used. However, if model is not supplied, this task’s default model’s config is used instead.

tokenizer (str or PreTrainedTokenizer, optional) — The tokenizer that will be used by the pipeline to encode data for the model. This can be a model identifier or an actual pretrained tokenizer inheriting from PreTrainedTokenizer.
If not provided, the default tokenizer for the given model will be loaded (if it is a string). If model is not specified or not a string, then the default tokenizer for config is loaded (if it is a string). However, if config is also not given or not a string, then the default tokenizer for the given task will be loaded.

feature_extractor (str or PreTrainedFeatureExtractor, optional) — The feature extractor that will be used by the pipeline to encode data for the model. This can be a model identifier or an actual pretrained feature extractor inheriting from PreTrainedFeatureExtractor.
Feature extractors are used for non-NLP models, such as Speech or Vision models as well as multi-modal models. Multi-modal models will also require a tokenizer to be passed.

If not provided, the default feature extractor for the given model will be loaded (if it is a string). If model is not specified or not a string, then the default feature extractor for config is loaded (if it is a string). However, if config is also not given or not a string, then the default feature extractor for the given task will be loaded.

framework (str, optional) — The framework to use, either "pt" for PyTorch or "tf" for TensorFlow. The specified framework must be installed.
If no framework is specified, will default to the one currently installed. If no framework is specified and both frameworks are installed, will default to the framework of the model, or to PyTorch if no model is provided.

revision (str, optional, defaults to "main") — When passing a task name or a string model identifier: The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so revision can be any identifier allowed by git.
use_fast (bool, optional, defaults to True) — Whether or not to use a Fast tokenizer if possible (a PreTrainedTokenizerFast).
use_auth_token (str or bool, optional) — The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If True, will use the token generated when running huggingface-cli login (stored in ~/.huggingface).
device (int or str or torch.device) — Defines the device (e.g., "cpu", "cuda:1", "mps", or a GPU ordinal rank like 1) on which this pipeline will be allocated.
device_map (str or Dict[str, Union[int, str, torch.device], optional) — Sent directly as model_kwargs (just a simpler shortcut). When accelerate library is present, set device_map="auto" to compute the most optimized device_map automatically (see here for more information).
Do not use device_map AND device at the same time as they will conflict

torch_dtype (str or torch.dtype, optional) — Sent directly as model_kwargs (just a simpler shortcut) to use the available precision for this model (torch.float16, torch.bfloat16, … or "auto").
trust_remote_code (bool, optional, defaults to False) — Whether or not to allow for custom code defined on the Hub in their own modeling, configuration, tokenization or even pipeline files. This option should only be set to True for repositories you trust and in which you have read the code, as it will execute code present on the Hub on your local machine.
model_kwargs (Dict[str, Any], optional) — Additional dictionary of keyword arguments passed along to the model’s from_pretrained(..., **model_kwargs) function.
kwargs (Dict[str, Any], optional) — Additional keyword arguments passed along to the specific pipeline init (see the documentation for the corresponding pipeline class for possible values).
A suitable pipeline for the task.


Utility factory method to build a Pipeline.

Pipelines are made of:

A tokenizer in charge of mapping raw textual input to token.
A model to make predictions from the inputs.
Some (optional) post processing for enhancing model’s output.
Examples:

>>> from transformers import pipeline, AutoModelForTokenClassification, AutoTokenizer

>>> # Sentiment analysis pipeline
>>> analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

>>> # Question answering pipeline, specifying the checkpoint identifier
>>> oracle = pipeline(
...     "question-answering", model="distilbert/distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad", tokenizer="google-bert/bert-base-cased"
... )

>>> # Named entity recognition pipeline, passing in a specific model and tokenizer
>>> model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english")
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google-bert/bert-base-cased")
>>> recognizer = pipeline("ner", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
Pipeline batching

All pipelines can use batching. This will work whenever the pipeline uses its streaming ability (so when passing lists or Dataset or generator).

from transformers import pipeline
from transformers.pipelines.pt_utils import KeyDataset
import datasets

dataset = datasets.load_dataset("imdb", name="plain_text", split="unsupervised")
pipe = pipeline("text-classification", device=0)
for out in pipe(KeyDataset(dataset, "text"), batch_size=8, truncation="only_first"):
    print(out)
    # [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998743534088135}]
    # Exactly the same output as before, but the content are passed
    # as batches to the model
However, this is not automatically a win for performance. It can be either a 10x speedup or 5x slowdown depending on hardware, data and the actual model being used.

Example where it’s mostly a speedup:

from transformers import pipeline
from torch.utils.data import Dataset
from tqdm.auto import tqdm

pipe = pipeline("text-classification", device=0)


class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __len__(self):
        return 5000

    def __getitem__(self, i):
        return "This is a test"


dataset = MyDataset()

for batch_size in [1, 8, 64, 256]:
    print("-" * 30)
    print(f"Streaming batch_size={batch_size}")
    for out in tqdm(pipe(dataset, batch_size=batch_size), total=len(dataset)):
        pass
# On GTX 970

Example where it’s most a slowdown:

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __len__(self):
        return 5000

    def __getitem__(self, i):
        if i % 64 == 0:
            n = 100
        else:
            n = 1
        return "This is a test" * n
This is a occasional very long sentence compared to the other. In that case, the whole batch will need to be 400 tokens long, so the whole batch will be [64, 400] instead of [64, 4], leading to the high slowdown. Even worse, on bigger batches, the program simply crashes.

There are no good (general) solutions for this problem, and your mileage may vary depending on your use cases. Rule of thumb:

For users, a rule of thumb is:

Measure performance on your load, with your hardware. Measure, measure, and keep measuring. Real numbers are the only way to go.

If you are latency constrained (live product doing inference), don’t batch.

If you are using CPU, don’t batch.

If you are using throughput (you want to run your model on a bunch of static data), on GPU, then:

If you have no clue about the size of the sequence_length (“natural” data), by default don’t batch, measure and try tentatively to add it, add OOM checks to recover when it will fail (and it will at some point if you don’t control the sequence_length.)
If your sequence_length is super regular, then batching is more likely to be VERY interesting, measure and push it until you get OOMs.
The larger the GPU the more likely batching is going to be more interesting
As soon as you enable batching, make sure you can handle OOMs nicely.

Pipeline chunk batching

zero-shot-classification and question-answering are slightly specific in the sense, that a single input might yield multiple forward pass of a model. Under normal circumstances, this would yield issues with batch_size argument.

In order to circumvent this issue, both of these pipelines are a bit specific, they are ChunkPipeline instead of regular Pipeline. In short:

preprocessed = pipe.preprocess(inputs)
model_outputs = pipe.forward(preprocessed)
outputs = pipe.postprocess(model_outputs)
Now becomes:

all_model_outputs = []
for preprocessed in pipe.preprocess(inputs):
    model_outputs = pipe.forward(preprocessed)
    all_model_outputs.append(model_outputs)
outputs = pipe.postprocess(all_model_outputs)
This should be very transparent to your code because the pipelines are used in the same way.

This is a simplified view, since the pipeline can handle automatically the batch to ! Meaning you don’t have to care about how many forward passes you inputs are actually going to trigger, you can optimize the batch_size independently of the inputs. The caveats from the previous section still apply.

Pipeline FP16 inference

Models can be run in FP16 which can be significantly faster on GPU while saving memory. Most models will not suffer noticeable performance loss from this. The larger the model, the less likely that it will.

To enable FP16 inference, you can simply pass torch_dtype=torch.float16 or torch_dtype='float16' to the pipeline constructor. Note that this only works for models with a PyTorch backend. Your inputs will be converted to FP16 internally.

Pipeline custom code

If you want to override a specific pipeline.

Don’t hesitate to create an issue for your task at hand, the goal of the pipeline is to be easy to use and support most cases, so transformers could maybe support your use case.

If you want to try simply you can:

Subclass your pipeline of choice
class MyPipeline(TextClassificationPipeline):
    def postprocess():
        # Your code goes here
        scores = scores * 100
        # And here


my_pipeline = MyPipeline(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, ...)
# or if you use *pipeline* function, then:
my_pipeline = pipeline(model="xxxx", pipeline_class=MyPipeline)
That should enable you to do all the custom code you want.

Parameters

inputs (np.ndarray or bytes or str or dict) — The inputs is either :
str that is the filename of the audio file, the file will be read at the correct sampling rate to get the waveform using ffmpeg. This requires ffmpeg to be installed on the system.

AutomaticSpeechRecognitionPipeline

class transformers.AutomaticSpeechRecognitionPipeline

< source >
( model: PreTrainedModelfeature_extractor: Union = Nonetokenizer: Optional = Nonedecoder: Union = Nonedevice: Union = Nonetorch_dtype: Union = None**kwargs )

Parameters

model (PreTrainedModel or TFPreTrainedModel) — The model that will be used by the pipeline to make predictions. This needs to be a model inheriting from PreTrainedModel for PyTorch and TFPreTrainedModel for TensorFlow.
feature_extractor (SequenceFeatureExtractor) — The feature extractor that will be used by the pipeline to encode waveform for the model.
tokenizer (PreTrainedTokenizer) — The tokenizer that will be used by the pipeline to encode data for the model. This object inherits from PreTrainedTokenizer.
decoder (pyctcdecode.BeamSearchDecoderCTC, optional) — PyCTCDecode’s BeamSearchDecoderCTC can be passed for language model boosted decoding. See Wav2Vec2ProcessorWithLM for more information.
chunk_length_s (float, optional, defaults to 0) — The input length for in each chunk. If chunk_length_s = 0 then chunking is disabled (default).
For more information on how to effectively use chunk_length_s, please have a look at the ASR chunking blog post.

stride_length_s (float, optional, defaults to chunk_length_s / 6) — The length of stride on the left and right of each chunk. Used only with chunk_length_s > 0. This enables the model to see more context and infer letters better than without this context but the pipeline discards the stride bits at the end to make the final reconstitution as perfect as possible.
For more information on how to effectively use stride_length_s, please have a look at the ASR chunking blog post.

framework (str, optional) — The framework to use, either "pt" for PyTorch or "tf" for TensorFlow. The specified framework must be installed. If no framework is specified, will default to the one currently installed. If no framework is specified and both frameworks are installed, will default to the framework of the model, or to PyTorch if no model is provided.
device (Union[int, torch.device], optional) — Device ordinal for CPU/GPU supports. Setting this to None will leverage CPU, a positive will run the model on the associated CUDA device id.
torch_dtype (Union[int, torch.dtype], optional) — The data-type (dtype) of the computation. Setting this to None will use float32 precision. Set to torch.float16 or torch.bfloat16 to use half-precision in the respective dtypes.
Pipeline that aims at extracting spoken text contained within some audio.

The input can be either a raw waveform or a audio file. In case of the audio file, ffmpeg should be installed for to support multiple audio formats

Example:

>>> from transformers import pipeline

( inputs: Union**kwargs ) → Dict

Parameters

inputs (np.ndarray or bytes or str or dict) — The inputs is either :
str that is either the filename of a local audio file, or a public URL address to download the audio file. The file will be read at the correct sampling rate to get the waveform using ffmpeg. This requires ffmpeg to be installed on the system.
bytes it is supposed to be the content of an audio file and is interpreted by ffmpeg in the same way.
(np.ndarray of shape (n, ) of type np.float32 or np.float64) Raw audio at the correct sampling rate (no further check will be done)
dict form can be used to pass raw audio sampled at arbitrary sampling_rate and let this pipeline do the resampling. The dict must be in the format {"sampling_rate": int, "raw": np.array} with optionally a "stride": (left: int, right: int) than can ask the pipeline to treat the first left samples and last right samples to be ignored in decoding (but used at inference to provide more context to the model). Only use stride with CTC models.
return_timestamps (optional, str or bool) — Only available for pure CTC models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, etc) and the Whisper model. Not available for other sequence-to-sequence models.
For CTC models, timestamps can take one of two formats:

"char": the pipeline will return timestamps along the text for every character in the text. For instance, if you get [{"text": "h", "timestamp": (0.5, 0.6)}, {"text": "i", "timestamp": (0.7, 0.9)}], then it means the model predicts that the letter “h” was spoken after 0.5 and before 0.6 seconds.
"word": the pipeline will return timestamps along the text for every word in the text. For instance, if you get [{"text": "hi ", "timestamp": (0.5, 0.9)}, {"text": "there", "timestamp": (1.0, 1.5)}], then it means the model predicts that the word “hi” was spoken after 0.5 and before 0.9 seconds.
For the Whisper model, timestamps can take one of two formats:

"word": same as above for word-level CTC timestamps. Word-level timestamps are predicted through the dynamic-time warping (DTW) algorithm, an approximation to word-level timestamps by inspecting the cross-attention weights.
True: the pipeline will return timestamps along the text for segments of words in the text. For instance, if you get [{"text": " Hi there!", "timestamp": (0.5, 1.5)}], then it means the model predicts that the segment “Hi there!” was spoken after 0.5 and before 1.5 seconds. Note that a segment of text refers to a sequence of one or more words, rather than individual words as with word-level timestamps.
generate_kwargs (dict, optional) — The dictionary of ad-hoc parametrization of generate_config to be used for the generation call. For a complete overview of generate, check the following guide.
max_new_tokens (int, optional) — The maximum numbers of tokens to generate, ignoring the number of tokens in the prompt.
A dictionary with the following keys:

text (str): The recognized text.
chunks (optional(, List[Dict]) When using return_timestamps, the chunks will become a list containing all the various text chunks identified by the model, e.g.* [{"text": "hi ", "timestamp": (0.5, 0.9)}, {"text": "there", "timestamp": (1.0, 1.5)}]. The original full text can roughly be recovered by doing "".join(chunk["text"] for chunk in output["chunks"]).

Transcribe the audio sequence(s) given as inputs to text. See the AutomaticSpeechRecognitionPipeline documentation for more information.

TextToAudioPipeline

class transformers.TextToAudioPipeline

< source >
( *argsvocoder = Nonesampling_rate = None**kwargs )

Text-to-audio generation pipeline using any AutoModelForTextToWaveform or AutoModelForTextToSpectrogram. This pipeline generates an audio file from an input text and optional other conditional inputs.

Example:

>>> from transformers import pipeline

This mask filling pipeline can currently be loaded from pipeline() using the following task identifier: "fill-mask".

The models that this pipeline can use are models that have been trained with a masked language modeling objective, which includes the bi-directional models in the library. See the up-to-date list of available models on huggingface.co/models.

This pipeline only works for inputs with exactly one token masked. Experimental: We added support for multiple masks. The returned values are raw model output, and correspond to disjoint probabilities where one might expect joint probabilities (See discussion).

This pipeline now supports tokenizer_kwargs. For example try:

>>> from transformers import pipeline

>>> fill_masker = pipeline(model="google-bert/bert-base-uncased")
>>> tokenizer_kwargs = {"truncation": True}
>>> fill_masker(
...     "This is a simple [MASK]. " + "...with a large amount of repeated text appended. " * 100,
...     tokenizer_kwargs=tokenizer_kwargs,
... )

This text classification pipeline can currently be loaded from pipeline() using the following task identifier: "sentiment-analysis" (for classifying sequences according to positive or negative sentiments).

If multiple classification labels are available (model.config.num_labels >= 2), the pipeline will run a softmax over the results. If there is a single label, the pipeline will run a sigmoid over the result.

The models that this pipeline can use are models that have been fine-tuned on a sequence classification task. See the up-to-date list of available models on huggingface.co/models.

Language generation pipeline using any ModelWithLMHead. This pipeline predicts the words that will follow a specified text prompt. When the underlying model is a conversational model, it can also accept one or more chats, in which case the pipeline will operate in chat mode and will continue the chat(s) by adding its response(s). Each chat takes the form of a list of dicts, where each dict contains “role” and “content” keys.

Examples:

>>> from transformers import pipeline

>>> generator = pipeline(model="openai-community/gpt2")
>>> generator("I can't believe you did such a ", do_sample=False)
[{'generated_text': "I can't believe you did such a icky thing to me. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I"}]

>>> # These parameters will return suggestions, and only the newly created text making it easier for prompting suggestions.
>>> outputs = generator("My tart needs some", num_return_sequences=4, return_full_text=False)
>>> from transformers import pipeline

>>> generator = pipeline(model="HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta")
>>> # Zephyr-beta is a conversational model, so let's pass it a chat instead of a single string
>>> generator([{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France? Answer in one word."}], do_sample=False, max_new_tokens=2)
[{'generated_text': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'What is the capital of France? Answer in one word.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Paris'}]}]

__call__

< source >
( text_inputs**kwargs ) → A list or a list of lists of dict

Parameters

text_inputs (str, List[str], List[Dict[str, str]], or List[List[Dict[str, str]]]) — One or several prompts (or one list of prompts) to complete. If strings or a list of string are passed, this pipeline will continue each prompt. Alternatively, a “chat”, in the form of a list of dicts with “role” and “content” keys, can be passed, or a list of such chats. When chats are passed, the model’s chat template will be used to format them before passing them to the model.
return_tensors (bool, optional, defaults to False) — Whether or not to return the tensors of predictions (as token indices) in the outputs. If set to True, the decoded text is not returned.
return_text (bool, optional, defaults to True) — Whether or not to return the decoded texts in the outputs.
return_full_text (bool, optional, defaults to True) — If set to False only added text is returned, otherwise the full text is returned. Only meaningful if return_text is set to True.
clean_up_tokenization_spaces (bool, optional, defaults to True) — Whether or not to clean up the potential extra spaces in the text output.
continue_final_message( bool, optional) — This indicates that you want the model to continue the last message in the input chat rather than starting a new one, allowing you to “prefill” its response. By default this is True when the final message in the input chat has the assistant role and False otherwise, but you can manually override that behaviour by setting this flag.
prefix (str, optional) — Prefix added to prompt.
handle_long_generation (str, optional) — By default, this pipelines does not handle long generation (ones that exceed in one form or the other the model maximum length). There is no perfect way to adress this (more info :https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/14033#issuecomment-948385227). This provides common strategies to work around that problem depending on your use case.
None : default strategy where nothing in particular happens
"hole": Truncates left of input, and leaves a gap wide enough to let generation happen (might truncate a lot of the prompt and not suitable when generation exceed the model capacity)
generate_kwargs (dict, optional) — Additional keyword arguments to pass along to the generate method of the model (see the generate method corresponding to your framework here).
Returns

A list or a list of lists of dict

Returns one of the following dictionaries (cannot return a combination of both generated_text and generated_token_ids):

generated_text (str, present when return_text=True) — The generated text.
generated_token_ids (torch.Tensor or tf.Tensor, present when return_tensors=True) — The token ids of the generated text.

( args_parser = <transformers.pipelines.token_classification.TokenClassificationArgumentHandler object at 0x7f52082828f0>*args**kwargs )

Parameters

model (PreTrainedModel or TFPreTrainedModel) — The model that will be used by the pipeline to make predictions. This needs to be a model inheriting from PreTrainedModel for PyTorch and TFPreTrainedModel for TensorFlow.
tokenizer (PreTrainedTokenizer) — The tokenizer that will be used by the pipeline to encode data for the model. This object inherits from PreTrainedTokenizer.
modelcard (str or ModelCard, optional) — Model card attributed to the model for this pipeline.
framework (str, optional) — The framework to use, either "pt" for PyTorch or "tf" for TensorFlow. The specified framework must be installed.

task (str, defaults to "") — A task-identifier for the pipeline.
num_workers (int, optional, defaults to 8) — When the pipeline will use DataLoader (when passing a dataset, on GPU for a Pytorch model), the number of workers to be used.
batch_size (int, optional, defaults to 1) — When the pipeline will use DataLoader (when passing a dataset, on GPU for a Pytorch model), the size of the batch to use, for inference this is not always beneficial, please read Batching with pipelines .
args_parser (ArgumentHandler, optional) — Reference to the object in charge of parsing supplied pipeline parameters.

binary_output (bool, optional, defaults to False) — Flag indicating if the output the pipeline should happen in a serialized format (i.e., pickle) or as the raw output data e.g. text.
ignore_labels (List[str], defaults to ["O"]) — A list of labels to ignore.
grouped_entities (bool, optional, defaults to False) — DEPRECATED, use aggregation_strategy instead. Whether or not to group the tokens corresponding to the same entity together in the predictions or not.
stride (int, optional) — If stride is provided, the pipeline is applied on all the text. The text is split into chunks of size model_max_length. Works only with fast tokenizers and aggregation_strategy different from NONE. The value of this argument defines the number of overlapping tokens between chunks. In other words, the model will shift forward by tokenizer.model_max_length - stride tokens each step.
aggregation_strategy (str, optional, defaults to "none") — The strategy to fuse (or not) tokens based on the model prediction.
“none” : Will simply not do any aggregation and simply return raw results from the model
“simple” : Will attempt to group entities following the default schema. (A, B-TAG), (B, I-TAG), (C, I-TAG), (D, B-TAG2) (E, B-TAG2) will end up being [{“word”: ABC, “entity”: “TAG”}, {“word”: “D”, “entity”: “TAG2”}, {“word”: “E”, “entity”: “TAG2”}] Notice that two consecutive B tags will end up as different entities. On word based languages, we might end up splitting words undesirably : Imagine Microsoft being tagged as [{“word”: “Micro”, “entity”: “ENTERPRISE”}, {“word”: “soft”, “entity”: “NAME”}]. Look for FIRST, MAX, AVERAGE for ways to mitigate that and disambiguate words (on languages that support that meaning, which is basically tokens separated by a space). These mitigations will only work on real words, “New york” might still be tagged with two different entities.
“first” : (works only on word based models) Will use the SIMPLE strategy except that words, cannot end up with different tags. Words will simply use the tag of the first token of the word when there is ambiguity.
“average” : (works only on word based models) Will use the SIMPLE strategy except that words, cannot end up with different tags. scores will be averaged first across tokens, and then the maximum label is applied.
“max” : (works only on word based models) Will use the SIMPLE strategy except that words, cannot end up with different tags. Word entity will simply be the token with the maximum score.

NLI-based zero-shot classification pipeline using a ModelForSequenceClassification trained on NLI (natural language inference) tasks. Equivalent of text-classification pipelines, but these models don’t require a hardcoded number of potential classes, they can be chosen at runtime. It usually means it’s slower but it is much more flexible.

Any combination of sequences and labels can be passed and each combination will be posed as a premise/hypothesis pair and passed to the pretrained model. Then, the logit for entailment is taken as the logit for the candidate label being valid. Any NLI model can be used, but the id of the entailment label must be included in the model config’s :attr:~transformers.PretrainedConfig.label2id.

Example:

>>> from transformers import pipeline

>>> oracle = pipeline(model="facebook/bart-large-mnli")

This NLI pipeline can currently be loaded from pipeline() using the following task identifier: "zero-shot-classification".

The models that this pipeline can use are models that have been fine-tuned on an NLI task. See the up-to-date list of available models on huggingface.co/models.

__call__

< source >
( sequences: Union*args**kwargs ) → A dict or a list of dict

Parameters

sequences (str or List[str]) — The sequence(s) to classify, will be truncated if the model input is too large.
candidate_labels (str or List[str]) — The set of possible class labels to classify each sequence into. Can be a single label, a string of comma-separated labels, or a list of labels.
hypothesis_template (str, optional, defaults to "This example is {}.") — The template used to turn each label into an NLI-style hypothesis. This template must include a {} or similar syntax for the candidate label to be inserted into the template. For example, the default template is "This example is {}." With the candidate label "sports", this would be fed into the model like "<cls> sequence to classify <sep> This example is sports . <sep>". The default template works well in many cases, but it may be worthwhile to experiment with different templates depending on the task setting.
multi_label (bool, optional, defaults to False) — Whether or not multiple candidate labels can be true. If False, the scores are normalized such that the sum of the label likelihoods for each sequence is 1. If True, the labels are considered independent and probabilities are normalized for each candidate by doing a softmax of the entailment score vs. the contradiction score.
Returns

A dict or a list of dict

Each result comes as a dictionary with the following keys:

sequence (str) — The sequence for which this is the output.
labels (List[str]) — The labels sorted by order of likelihood.
scores (List[float]) — The probabilities for each of the labels.

Classify the sequence(s) given as inputs. See the ZeroShotClassificationPipeline documentation for more information.

This document question answering pipeline can currently be loaded from pipeline() using the following task identifier: "document-question-answering".

The models that this pipeline can use are models that have been fine-tuned on a document question answering task. See the up-to-date list of available models on huggingface.co/models.

__call__

< source >
( image: Unionquestion: Optional = Noneword_boxes: Tuple = None**kwargs ) → A dict or a list of dict

Parameters

image (str or PIL.Image) — The pipeline handles three types of images:
A string containing a http link pointing to an image
A string containing a local path to an image
An image loaded in PIL directly
The pipeline accepts either a single image or a batch of images. If given a single image, it can be broadcasted to multiple questions.

question (str) — A question to ask of the document.
word_boxes (List[str, Tuple[float, float, float, float]], optional) — A list of words and bounding boxes (normalized 0->1000). If you provide this optional input, then the pipeline will use these words and boxes instead of running OCR on the image to derive them for models that need them (e.g. LayoutLM). This allows you to reuse OCR’d results across many invocations of the pipeline without having to re-run it each time.
top_k (int, optional, defaults to 1) — The number of answers to return (will be chosen by order of likelihood). Note that we return less than top_k answers if there are not enough options available within the context.
doc_stride (int, optional, defaults to 128) — If the words in the document are too long to fit with the question for the model, it will be split in several chunks with some overlap. This argument controls the size of that overlap.
max_answer_len (int, optional, defaults to 15) — The maximum length of predicted answers (e.g., only answers with a shorter length are considered).
max_seq_len (int, optional, defaults to 384) — The maximum length of the total sentence (context + question) in tokens of each chunk passed to the model. The context will be split in several chunks (using doc_stride as overlap) if needed.
max_question_len (int, optional, defaults to 64) — The maximum length of the question after tokenization. It will be truncated if needed.
handle_impossible_answer (bool, optional, defaults to False) — Whether or not we accept impossible as an answer.
lang (str, optional) — Language to use while running OCR. Defaults to english.
tesseract_config (str, optional) — Additional flags to pass to tesseract while running OCR.
timeout (float, optional, defaults to None) — The maximum time in seconds to wait for fetching images from the web. If None, no timeout is set and the call may block forever.
Returns

A dict or a list of dict

Each result comes as a dictionary with the following keys:

score (float) — The probability associated to the answer.
start (int) — The start word index of the answer (in the OCR’d version of the input or provided word_boxes).
end (int) — The end word index of the answer (in the OCR’d version of the input or provided word_boxes).
answer (str) — The answer to the question.
words (list[int]) — The index of each word/box pair that is in the answer

Answer the question(s) given as inputs by using the document(s). A document is defined as an image and an optional list of (word, box) tuples which represent the text in the document. If the word_boxes are not provided, it will use the Tesseract OCR engine (if available) to extract the words and boxes automatically for LayoutLM-like models which require them as input. For Donut, no OCR is run.

You can invoke the pipeline several ways:

pipeline(image=image, question=question)
pipeline(image=image, question=question, word_boxes=word_boxes)
pipeline([{"image": image, "question": question}])
pipeline([{"image": image, "question": question, "word_boxes": word_boxes}])

Automatic mask generation for images using SamForMaskGeneration. This pipeline predicts binary masks for an image, given an image. It is a ChunkPipeline because you can seperate the points in a mini-batch in order to avoid OOM issues. Use the points_per_batch argument to control the number of points that will be processed at the same time. Default is 64.

The pipeline works in 3 steps:

preprocess: A grid of 1024 points evenly separated is generated along with bounding boxes and point labels. For more details on how the points and bounding boxes are created, check the _generate_crop_boxes function. The image is also preprocessed using the image_processor. This function yields a minibatch of points_per_batch.

forward: feeds the outputs of preprocess to the model. The image embedding is computed only once. Calls both self.model.get_image_embeddings and makes sure that the gradients are not computed, and the tensors and models are on the same device.

postprocess: The most important part of the automatic mask generation happens here. Three steps are induced:

image_processor.postprocess_masks (run on each minibatch loop): takes in the raw output masks, resizes them according to the image size, and transforms there to binary masks.
image_processor.filter_masks (on each minibatch loop): uses both pred_iou_thresh and stability_scores. Also applies a variety of filters based on non maximum suppression to remove bad masks.
image_processor.postprocess_masks_for_amg applies the NSM on the mask to only keep relevant ones.
Example:

>>> from transformers import pipeline

>>> generator = pipeline(model="facebook/sam-vit-base", task="mask-generation")
>>> outputs = generator(
...     "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg",

A dictionary or a list of dictionaries containing the result. The dictionaries contain the following keys

label (str) — The label identified by the model.
score (int) — The score attributed by the model for that label.

Answers open-ended questions about images. The pipeline accepts several types of inputs which are detailed below:

pipeline(image=image, question=question)
pipeline({"image": image, "question": question})
pipeline([{"image": image, "question": question}])
pipeline([{"image": image, "question": question}, {"image": image, "question": question}])

Parameters

model (PreTrainedModel or TFPreTrainedModel) — The model that will be used by the pipeline to make predictions. This needs to be a model inheriting from PreTrainedModel for PyTorch and TFPreTrainedModel for TensorFlow.
tokenizer (PreTrainedTokenizer) — The tokenizer that will be used by the pipeline to encode data for the model. This object inherits from PreTrainedTokenizer.
feature_extractor (SequenceFeatureExtractor) — The feature extractor that will be used by the pipeline to encode data for the model. This object inherits from SequenceFeatureExtractor.
image_processor (BaseImageProcessor) — The image processor that will be used by the pipeline to encode data for the model. This object inherits from BaseImageProcessor.
modelcard (str or ModelCard, optional) — Model card attributed to the model for this pipeline.
framework (str, optional) — The framework to use, either "pt" for PyTorch or "tf" for TensorFlow. The specified framework must be installed.
If no framework is specified, will default to the one currently installed. If no framework is specified and both frameworks are installed, will default to the framework of the model, or to PyTorch if no model is provided.

task (str, defaults to "") — A task-identifier for the pipeline.
num_workers (int, optional, defaults to 8) — When the pipeline will use DataLoader (when passing a dataset, on GPU for a Pytorch model), the number of workers to be used.
batch_size (int, optional, defaults to 1) — When the pipeline will use DataLoader (when passing a dataset, on GPU for a Pytorch model), the size of the batch to use, for inference this is not always beneficial, please read Batching with pipelines .
args_parser (ArgumentHandler, optional) — Reference to the object in charge of parsing supplied pipeline parameters.
device (int, optional, defaults to -1) — Device ordinal for CPU/GPU supports. Setting this to -1 will leverage CPU, a positive will run the model on the associated CUDA device id. You can pass native torch.device or a str too
torch_dtype (str or torch.dtype, optional) — Sent directly as model_kwargs (just a simpler shortcut) to use the available precision for this model (torch.float16, torch.bfloat16, … or "auto")
binary_output (bool, optional, defaults to False) — Flag indicating if the output the pipeline should happen in a serialized format (i.e., pickle) or as the raw output data e.g. text.
The Pipeline class is the class from which all pipelines inherit. Refer to this class for methods shared across different pipelines.

Base class implementing pipelined operations. Pipeline workflow is defined as a sequence of the following operations:

Input -> Tokenization -> Model Inference -> Post-Processing (task dependent) -> Output

Pipeline supports running on CPU or GPU through the device argument (see below).

Some pipeline, like for instance FeatureExtractionPipeline ('feature-extraction') output large tensor object as nested-lists. In order to avoid dumping such large structure as textual data we provide the binary_output constructor argument. If set to True, the output will be stored in the pickle format.

check_model_type

< source >
( supported_models: Union )

Parameters

supported_models (List[str] or dict) — The list of models supported by the pipeline, or a dictionary with model class values.
Check if the model class is in supported by the pipeline.

Context Manager allowing tensor allocation on the user-specified device in framework agnostic way.

Examples:

# Explicitly ask for tensor allocation on CUDA device :0
pipe = pipeline(..., device=0)
with pipe.device_placement():
    # Every framework specific tensor allocation will be done on the request device
    output = pipe(...)
ensure_tensor_on_device

< source >
( **inputs ) → Dict[str, torch.Tensor]

Parameters

inputs (keyword arguments that should be torch.Tensor, the rest is ignored) — The tensors to place on self.device.
Recursive on lists only. —
Returns

Dict[str, torch.Tensor]

The same as inputs but on the proper device.


Ensure PyTorch tensors are on the specified device.

postprocess

< source >
( model_outputs: ModelOutput**postprocess_parameters: Dict )

Postprocess will receive the raw outputs of the _forward method, generally tensors, and reformat them into something more friendly. Generally it will output a list or a dict or results (containing just strings and numbers).

Scikit / Keras interface to transformers’ pipelines. This method will forward to call().

preprocess

< source >
( input_: Any**preprocess_parameters: Dict )

Preprocess will take the input_ of a specific pipeline and return a dictionary of everything necessary for _forward to run properly. It should contain at least one tensor, but might have arbitrary other items.

( repo_id: struse_temp_dir: Optional = Nonecommit_message: Optional = Noneprivate: Optional = Nonetoken: Union = Nonemax_shard_size: Union = '5GB'create_pr: bool = Falsesafe_serialization: bool = Truerevision: str = Nonecommit_description: str = Nonetags: Optional = None**deprecated_kwargs )

Parameters

repo_id (str) — The name of the repository you want to push your pipe to. It should contain your organization name when pushing to a given organization.
use_temp_dir (bool, optional) — Whether or not to use a temporary directory to store the files saved before they are pushed to the Hub. Will default to True if there is no directory named like repo_id, False otherwise.
commit_message (str, optional) — Message to commit while pushing. Will default to "Upload pipe".
private (bool, optional) — Whether or not the repository created should be private.
token (bool or str, optional) — The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If True, will use the token generated when running huggingface-cli login (stored in ~/.huggingface). Will default to True if repo_url is not specified.
max_shard_size (int or str, optional, defaults to "5GB") — Only applicable for models. The maximum size for a checkpoint before being sharded. Checkpoints shard will then be each of size lower than this size. If expressed as a string, needs to be digits followed by a unit (like "5MB"). We default it to "5GB" so that users can easily load models on free-tier Google Colab instances without any CPU OOM issues.
create_pr (bool, optional, defaults to False) — Whether or not to create a PR with the uploaded files or directly commit.
safe_serialization (bool, optional, defaults to True) — Whether or not to convert the model weights in safetensors format for safer serialization.
revision (str, optional) — Branch to push the uploaded files to.
commit_description (str, optional) — The description of the commit that will be created
tags (List[str], optional) — List of tags to push on the Hub.
Upload the pipeline file to the 🤗 Model Hub.

Examples:

from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("google-bert/bert-base-cased")

# Push the pipe to your namespace with the name "my-finetuned-bert".
pipe.push_to_hub("my-finetuned-bert")

# Push the pipe to an organization with the name "my-finetuned-bert".
pipe.push_to_hub("huggingface/my-finetuned-bert")
save_pretrained
